    <h1>LIVING A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE</h1>
    <h2>How can I start living a healthy lifestyle?</h2>
        <p>Student life can be full of new and exciting experiences. There's often lots going on. It's important to take the time to look after yourself.<br>
            Which bring us to the first point. Managing our own stress</p>
        
    <h3>Managing stress</h3>
    <p>You might feel like there's a lot of pressure to do well academically. And pressure to be sociable. 
        <br> Try to build up strategies to manage stress before it gets too much. This can make it easier to respond to additional pressure <br> â€“ For example, around exam times.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Try out some mindfulness exercises. There's lots of evidence to suggest these can be really helpful, especially for managing stress. <br> Take a look at our mindfulness pages for more information.</li>
      <li> Try using a planner. This can help to keep track of deadlines and key commitments and organise your study.</li>
      <li> Take time out to relax. Getting away from your desk, even for short periods of time, can help keep you calm.</li>
      <li> Keep an eye on social commitments to avoid overloading your schedule around deadlines and exams.</li>
      <li> Try online support and apps. There are lots of apps and websites available that can help you to manage your stress levels.<br> For example, by offering a daily meditation or mindfulness practice. </li>
