    <h1>5 TIPS FOR EATING HEALTHY AS A STUDENT</h1>
    <p>Chances are you are you are here right now from the main page about how to live a healthy lifestyle as a student. <br><br>
     Well, going off to school brings with it major lifestyle changes. There’s a new environment, new people, and of course — new food. Like many college students, you may be intimidated by the idea of trying to eat healthy on your student schedule and budget, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. You may be wondering, "What are some tips for eating healthy as a student?"</p>

    <h2>1. EAT BREAKFAST</h2>
     <ul>
             Regardless of when you wake up, always eat a breakfast rich in fiber and protein. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and you should be feeding your brain as soon as you wake up to get ready for the day. If you’re rushing late to a class, grab a quick granola bar or a piece of fruit and peanut butter, or a protein smoothie. If you’re looking for breakfast options, try breakfast bars, overnight oats, oatmeal, yogurts/parfaits, and loaded toast. Don’t skip meals, especially the first meal of the day.
     </ul>

    <h2>2. EAT YOUR GREENS</h2>
    <ul>
        A good way to ensure you eat your greens is to enjoy them as a starter. <br> <br>

            By doing so, you’ll most likely finish all of your greens while you’re at your hungriest. This may cause you to eat fewer, perhaps less nutritious, meal components later. <br><br>
            
            It may lead you to eat fewer calories overall, which could result in weight loss. Plus, eating vegetables before a carb-rich meal has been shown to benefit blood sugar levels. <br><br>

    <ul>There are two important strategies to employ when you go grocery shopping: Make your shopping list ahead of time and don’t go to the store hungry.
        <br> <br>
        Not knowing exactly what you need makes room for impulse buying, while hunger can cause you to toss even more low-nutrient foods into your shopping cart.
        <br> <br>
        That’s why the best strategy is to plan ahead and write down what you need beforehand. By doing this and sticking to your list, you’ll not only buy healthier items to keep around the house, but you’ll also save money.</ul>
 
    <h2>4. INCREASE YOUR PROTEIN INTAKE</h2>
    <ul>Protein is often referred to as the king of nutrients, and it does seem to have some superpowers.
       <br><br>
        Due to its ability to affect your hunger and satiety hormones, it’s often consideredTrusted Source the most filling of the macronutrients.
        <br><br>
        One 2018 studyTrusted Source showed that eating a high-protein meal decreased levels of ghrelin, the hunger hormone, more than a high carb meal in people with obesity.
        <br><br>

    <h2>5. EAT EGGS, SPECIALLY FOR BREAKFAST</h2>
    <ul>When studying various types of calorie-matched breakfasts, eggs come out on top.
        <br><br>
        Eggs are rich in high quality protein and many essential nutrients that people often don’t get enough of, such as choline.
        <br><br>
        Eating eggs in the morning increases feelings of fullness. This has been shown to cause people to consume fewer calories at later meals. It can be quite helpful for weight loss if that’s your goal.
        <br><br>
        For example, one 2020 studyTrusted Source of 50 people found that eating an egg-based breakfast reduced feelings of hunger and decreased the amount of calories consumed later in the day than a breakfast of cereal.</ul>
